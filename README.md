# Multi-Channel-Notification-Delivery-System


This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a multi-channel notification delivery system in Node.js. The system allows sending notifications through various channels such as push notifications, SMS, and email.

Architecture Overview
The system consists of the following core components:

Notification Service: Responsible for receiving notification requests and dispatching them to appropriate channels.

Channel Manager: Manages different notification channels and provides a unified interface for the Notification Service to communicate with.

Notification Channels: Include Push, SMS, and Email channels, each with its own implementation for sending notifications.

Implementation Details
notificationService.js: Defines the NotificationService class responsible for sending notifications to multiple channels.

channelManager.js: Implements the ChannelManager class, which registers and manages different notification channels.

pushChannel.js, smsChannel.js, emailChannel.js: Implementations of Push, SMS, and Email channels, each with a send method for sending notifications.

Usage
Install dependencies:
Copy code
npm install
Run the application:
Copy code
node index.js
You can customize the message and channels to send notifications by modifying the index.js file.
Dependencies
No external dependencies are required for this simplified implementation. However, in a real-world scenario, you would need to integrate with external services for actual notification delivery (e.g., Twilio for SMS, Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications, SMTP for email).

Next Steps
Implement actual logic for sending notifications through respective channels using appropriate APIs or services.

Add error handling, retry mechanisms, and logging for better reliability and fault tolerance.

Consider scalability and performance optimizations for handling a large volume of notifications.
