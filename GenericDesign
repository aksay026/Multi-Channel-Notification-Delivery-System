Here's a generic design for a multi-channel notification delivery system in Node.js:

Explanation:
Notification Service: This is the core service responsible for receiving notification requests and dispatching them to appropriate channels. It acts as a centralized point of control.

Channel Manager: This component manages different notification channels. It abstracts away the complexity of interacting with individual channels and provides a unified interface for the Notification Service to communicate with.

Push Channel, SMS Channel, Email Channel, Custom Channel: These represent various communication channels through which notifications can be delivered. Each channel has its own manager responsible for interacting with external APIs specific to that channel.

Push API, SMS API, Email API, Custom API: These are the interfaces through which the Channel Managers communicate with external services to send notifications via their respective channels.

Implementation:
Notification Service: Implement a Node.js service that exposes an API for receiving notification requests. This service should validate incoming requests, determine the appropriate channel(s) based on the request parameters, and delegate the delivery to the Channel Manager.

Channel Manager: Implement a Channel Manager module responsible for managing different notification channels. It should provide methods for sending notifications to each channel.

Channel Implementations (Push, SMS, Email, Custom): Implement separate modules for each notification channel. These modules should encapsulate the logic for interacting with external APIs (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications, Twilio for SMS, SMTP for email).

API Integration: Integrate with external APIs for each channel to send notifications. Use Node.js libraries or SDKs provided by the respective services for easier integration.

Error Handling and Retry Mechanism: Implement error handling and retry mechanisms in case of failures during notification delivery. This ensures robustness and reliability of the system.
